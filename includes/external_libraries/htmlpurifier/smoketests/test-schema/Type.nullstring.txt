Type.nullstring
TYPE: string/null
DEFAULT: null
--DESCRIPTION--
The null type is not a type, but a flag that can be added to any type
making null a valid value for that entry. It's useful for saying, "Let
the software pick the value for me," or "Don't use this element" when
false has a special meaning.
