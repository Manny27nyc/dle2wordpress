URI.Host
TYPE: string/null
VERSION: 1.2.0
DEFAULT: NULL
--DESCRIPTION--

<p>
    Defines the domain name of the server, so we can determine whether or
    an absolute URI is from your website or not.  Not strictly necessary,
    as users should be using relative URIs to reference resources on your
    website.  It will, however, let you use absolute URIs to link to
    subdomains of the domain you post here: i.e. example.com will allow
    sub.example.com.  However, higher up domains will still be excluded:
    if you set %URI.Host to sub.example.com, example.com will be blocked.
    <strong>Note:</strong> This directive overrides %URI.Base because
    a given page may be on a sub-domain, but you wish HTML Purifier to be
    more relaxed and allow some of the parent domains too.
