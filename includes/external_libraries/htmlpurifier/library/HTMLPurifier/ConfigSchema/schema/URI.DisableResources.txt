URI.DisableResources
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 4.2.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
    Disables embedding resources, essentially meaning no pictures. You can
    still link to them though. See %URI.DisableExternalResources for why
    this might be a good idea.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note:</em> While this directive has been available since 1.3.0,
    it didn't actually start doing anything until 4.2.0.
