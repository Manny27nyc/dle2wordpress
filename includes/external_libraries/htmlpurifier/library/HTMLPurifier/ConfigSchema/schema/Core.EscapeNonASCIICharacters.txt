Core.EscapeNonASCIICharacters
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 1.4.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
This directive overcomes a deficiency in %Core.Encoding by blindly
converting all non-ASCII characters into decimal numeric entities before
converting it to its native encoding. This means that even characters that
can be expressed in the non-UTF-8 encoding will be entity-ized, which can
be a real downer for encodings like Big5. It also assumes that the ASCII
repetoire is available, although this is the case for almost all encodings.
Anyway, use UTF-8!
