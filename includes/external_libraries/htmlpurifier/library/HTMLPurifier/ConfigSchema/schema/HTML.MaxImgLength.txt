HTML.MaxImgLength
TYPE: int/null
DEFAULT: 1200
VERSION: 3.1.1
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
 This directive controls the maximum number of pixels in the width and
 height attributes in <code>img</code> tags. This is
 in place to prevent imagecrash attacks, disable with null at your own risk.
 This directive is similar to %CSS.MaxImgLength, and both should be
 concurrently edited, although there are
 subtle differences in the input format (the HTML max is an integer).
