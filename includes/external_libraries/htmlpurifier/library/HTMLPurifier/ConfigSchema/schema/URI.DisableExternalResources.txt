URI.DisableExternalResources
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 1.3.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
Disables the embedding of external resources, preventing users from
embedding things like images from other hosts. This prevents access
tracking (good for email viewers), bandwidth leeching, cross-site request
forging, goatse.cx posting, and other nasties, but also results in a loss
of end-user functionality (they can't directly post a pic they posted from
Flickr anymore). Use it if you don't have a robust user-content moderation
team.
