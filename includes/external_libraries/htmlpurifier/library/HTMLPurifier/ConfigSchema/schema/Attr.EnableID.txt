Attr.EnableID
TYPE: bool
DEFAULT: false
VERSION: 1.2.0
--DESCRIPTION--
Allows the ID attribute in HTML.  This is disabled by default due to the
fact that without proper configuration user input can easily break the
validation of a webpage by specifying an ID that is already on the
surrounding HTML.  If you don't mind throwing caution to the wind, enable
this directive, but I strongly recommend you also consider blacklisting IDs
you use (%Attr.IDBlacklist) or prefixing all user supplied IDs
(%Attr.IDPrefix).  When set to true HTML Purifier reverts to the behavior of
pre-1.2.0 versions.
