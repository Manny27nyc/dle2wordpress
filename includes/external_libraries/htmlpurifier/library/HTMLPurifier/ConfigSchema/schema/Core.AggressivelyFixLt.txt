Core.AggressivelyFixLt
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 2.1.0
DEFAULT: true
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
    This directive enables aggressive pre-filter fixes HTML Purifier can
    perform in order to ensure that open angled-brackets do not get killed
    during parsing stage. Enabling this will result in two preg_replace_callback
    calls and at least two preg_replace calls for every HTML document parsed;
    if your users make very well-formed HTML, you can set this directive false.
    This has no effect when DirectLex is used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Notice:</strong> This directive's default turned from false to true
    in HTML Purifier 3.2.0.
