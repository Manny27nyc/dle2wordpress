Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.TidyImpl
TYPE: mixed/null
VERSION: 3.1.0
DEFAULT: NULL
ALIASES: FilterParam.ExtractStyleBlocksTidyImpl
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
  If left NULL, HTML Purifier will attempt to instantiate a <code>csstidy</code>
  class to use for internal cleaning. This will usually be good enough.
</p>
<p>
  However, for trusted user input, you can set this to <code>false</code> to
  disable cleaning. In addition, you can supply your own concrete implementation
  of Tidy's interface to use, although I don't know why you'd want to do that.
